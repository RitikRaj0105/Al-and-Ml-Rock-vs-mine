Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

Overview

This project aims to classify objects as either "Rock" or "Mine" using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset, which contains sonar signals bounced off metal cylinders (mines) and rocks.

Dataset

The dataset consists of 208 samples with 60 numerical features each, representing frequency readings from sonar signals. The target variable has two classes:

R: Rock

M: Mine

Technologies Used

Python

NumPy & Pandas (for data processing)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
